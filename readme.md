In this assignment, I created an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

When I entered the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB databse

The user should be able to open API get routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data foer each of these routes will be dislated in a formatted JSON

When testing API POST, PUT and DELETE routes in Insomnia, the user should be able to sucessfully create, update and delete users and thoughts in the database.

The user should be able to API TEST and DELETE routes in Insomnia and be able to sucessfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user's friend list
